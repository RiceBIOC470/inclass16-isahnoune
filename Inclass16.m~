%The folder in this repository contains code implementing a Tracking
%algorithm to match cells (or anything else) between successive frames. 
% It is an implemenation of the algorithm described in this paper: 
%
% Sbalzarini IF, Koumoutsakos P (2005) Feature point tracking and trajectory analysis 
% for video imaging in cell biology. J Struct Biol 151:182?195.
%
%The main function for the code is called MatchFrames.m and it takes three
%arguments: 
% 1. A cell array of data called peaks. Each entry of peaks is data for a
% different time point. Each row in this data should be a different object
% (i.e. a cell) and the columns should be x-coordinate, y-coordinate,
% object area, tracking index, fluorescence intensities (could be multiple
% columns). The tracking index can be initialized to -1 in every row. It will
% be filled in by MatchFrames so that its value gives the row where the
% data on the same cell can be found in the next frame. 
%2. a frame number (frame). The function will fill in the 4th column of the
% array in peaks{frame-1} with the row number of the corresponding cell in
% peaks{frame} as described above.
%3. A single parameter for the matching (L). In the current implementation of the algorithm, 
% the meaning of this parameter is that objects further than L pixels apart will never be matched. 

% Continue working with the nfkb movie you worked with in hw4. 

% Part 1. Use the first 2 frames of the movie. Segment them any way you
% like and fill the peaks cell array as described above so that each of the two cells 
% has 6 column matrix with x,y,area,-1,chan1 intensity, chan 2 intensity
